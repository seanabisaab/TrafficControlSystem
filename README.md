# TrafficControlSystem
This project simulates a busy Intersection with left turns and pedestrian crosswalks on all four sides. It uses a light sensor to detect whether it is night or day and switch modes accordingly. It also uses two switches to act as pedestrian crosswalk push buttons, and another 2 switches that can disable the left turn lights. While a button is pressed, the lights will continue as usual, but once the countdown is complete, pedestrians will be allowed to cross and a new countdown starts. There is also a buzzer that beeps every second when a pedestrian crossing countdown is taking place.
